# ml-model-comparison
Built and compared two supervised machine learning models to predict outputs from real data. Evaluated model accuracy using MSE and R² and documented results for performance insights.

# Machine Learning Model Comparison

This project compares two machine learning models built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how different models perform on the same dataset and highlights the importance of model selection.
